          stickyversion="0" words="599">From the decline in affection of one relationship to the growing warmth of
        another, Facebook users will soon be able to chart their entire conversation history with friends, family and
        lovers using the company’s new communication system.  The social network website plans to combine text messages,
        emails and instant messages all in one place online.  Today, at an eagerly awaited presentation at Facebook
        headquarters in Palo Alto, California, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the site which now has 500 million users,
        unveiled the details of a product which some in the industry had been classing a “Gmail killer”, referring to
        Google’s email offering.  Zuckerberg, speaking to an assembled group of journalists, talked quickly but
        coherently as he revealed the philosophy behind the system.  He was especially keen to stress one point. “It’s
        not email,” he said early in his presentation. “It’s true that people will be able to have an @facebook.com
        email addresses, but it’s not email.”  The new service, which will be called Facebook Messages, will offer a
        social inbox and “seamless messaging”, a clearly excited Zuckerberg said.  What that means is that if users so
        wish the company will now begin to compile their chatter from across four platforms: text messages, instant
        messages (IMs), emails and messages sent on Facebook.  The Facebook chief executive said that, in addition to
        the benefit of the software pooling messages from different devices, another boon would come as Facebook
        Messages provided the ultimate in spam and message filtering – a feat that existing email services have never
        fully accomplished, he suggested. “There are a lot of different classes of junk, and it’s really difficult for
        any email system to know [that] ‘this is a person who is sending me a legitimate message but you just don’t care
        about what they have to say’,” he said, displaying a glimpse of the social awareness – or lack of – for which he
        is famed.  Facebook Messages will prevent communiques from the unwanted, Zuckerberg continued, as users would be
        able to alter their settings in a manner similar to the current Facebook privacy settings, allowing messages
        through from “Friends only” or “Friends of Friends”. Conversation histories going back years would be saved into
        users’ accounts and spam filtered out, he claimed.  Demonstrating the new tool – after making his own,
        apparently obligatory, “it’s not email” preface – Facebook’s director of engineering, Andrew Bosworth, pulled up
        his personal chat history with his girlfriend, saying that he was really jealous that the “next generation”
        would be able to see their entire conversation history with their own partner or friends.  Whether this next
        generation will want to see every single utterance they have ever exchanged with their incumbent is a different
        matter – one can imagine good reason for not recording some heat-of-the-moment remarks for all
        eternity.  Questioned on the wisdom of total documentation Bosworth stressed that users of the service would be
        able to delete conversations.  So will Facebook Messages be the future of communication, or will it be the next
        Google wave?  The latter was another development much heralded at the time as a way to unify communication on
        the web. It was released in May 2009 and quietly disbanded in August this year.  “The key for Facebook’s success
        with messaging will be to get the privacy settings right the first time,” was the snap reaction of Michael
        Gartenberg, consumer specialist at the technology analysis company Gartner. Ironically he provided his view on
        Twitter.  Only time will tell how successful the ubiquitous social networking site’s latest development proves
        to be.  For the time being, just remember not to call it email.
