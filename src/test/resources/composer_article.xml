          stickyversion="0" words="632">In the genteel world of clay pigeon and game shooting, Sportsman Gun Centre is
        something of a household name as Britain’s leading purveyor of hunting rifles and related paraphernalia. Yet
        lately, the company appears to have branched out into a very different sector. Details released under the
        Freedom of Information Act reveal the company was the source of more than 1,000 assault rifles, combat shotguns,
        pistols and other weapons shipped last year to Sri Lanka, which has been brought back into the fold as a market
        for British arms in the wake of the brutal end to its civil war, in 2009. Figures published by the British
        government’s Export Controls Organisation recently indicated something of a surge in arms sales to the nation,
        which is still classified by the Foreign Office as a “country of concern” for rights abuses. Export licences
        worth £3.741m, of which just over £3m were military items, were approved in the three months between July –
        September last year. More than £2m of the sales came under the “ML1” label – a category denoting small arms and
        weapons.  The British government says that the small arms were for export to maritime mercenaries countering the
        threat of pirates in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. However, campaigners against the arms trade say that
        anti-piracy measures are being increasingly used by the government to justify arms sales and that the final
        destination for the weapons is often ambiguous. Kaye Stearman of the Campaign Against the Arms Trade said that
        there was already widespread concern about the use of private security companies in anti-piracy operations and
        that the chairperson of the UN working group on the use of mercenaries had said that a lack of regulation for
        armed security on ships and the absence of robust reporting for incidents at sea create risks for human
        rights. “Although hundreds of companies have signed up to an international code of conduct for private security
        providers, this is a voluntary agreement,” said Stearman. “In the case of Sri Lanka, there is always the
        possibility that weapons supposedly licensed for use in anti-piracy operations, will be used within Sri Lanka.
        Once weapons are licensed and dispatched abroad, the exporter has no control how or where they are used. “ The
        Sportsman Gun centre did not respond to a request for comment. The company has grown from the small operation
        established in Paignton by businessman Gary Lamburn, who bought an ailing gun centre on the verge of bankruptcy
        in 1993. He was later joined by co-owner Aboo Cattran, while the company has continued to expand, acquiring
        South Wales-based D J Litt’s in 2008, which gave Sportsman a 70% share of the market. It has three outlets in
        the West Country, rural Dorset and Wales. The acquisition of Litt’s, which was heavily involved in retailing and
        exporting, also opened the door to expansion into the US and European markets, Lamburn said at the time. A
        website offers a wide range of guns including pistols, shotguns and rifles by brands such as Beretta and
        Browning. Popular products include the Steyr AUG-Z, the “civilian” version of the assault rifle used by a number
        of national armies, and which sells for £1,580.99. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “The UK
        government takes its export licensing responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most rigorous arms
        export control regimes in the world. When we grant export licences for anti-piracy work, we take every
        precaution to ensure that those exports are only used for their intended purpose. “ “This includes requiring end
        users to provide a declaration that states the intended use and location for the products. They are also
        assessed carefully against the risk that the goods might be diverted or re-exported to undesirable end uses or
        end users.”
